1. What is Multimedia?
People who use term "multimedia" may have quite differen, even opposing and viewpoints. A consumer entertainment vendor, say a phone company, may think of multimedia as interactive TV with hundreds of digital channels or something like this.
Also, as a software student, when I read this book then I hhave some different view point of application-oriented what multimedia consists of: Application that multiple modalities to their advantages, in cluding text, sound (also seem as speech), images, drawings, graphics, etc...
This constracts with media thaat only use rudimetary computer display or text-only or traditional forms printed or hand-producted products
