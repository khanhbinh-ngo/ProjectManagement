## Common knowledge about CSI
- This is known as channel properties of a communication link.
- This information describes how a signal propagates from the transmitter to the receiver and presents the combined effect of, for example, scattering, fading, and power decay with ditance
- CSI sum up to the containation of multiple change in a information state through media. More over, if we use that to our project, the most common thing is know how to applicate in our device


# Different kinds of channel state information
    - There are basically 2 common types of channel state information: instantaeous CSI and statical CSI 
    - *instantaeous  CSI* - or we can name that short-term  CSI 
    - *statical CSI* - or we can name that long-term CSI 
- The CSI acquisition is practically limited by how fast the channel conditiion are changing.

# Mathematical description
# Estimation of CSI
# Data-aided versus blind estimation

## Our structure for that case study
1. In transmitter site
#### Some note that need readed
