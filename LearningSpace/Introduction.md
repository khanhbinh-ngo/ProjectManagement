## I. Define Product Management
### 1/ Define PM
- Project management is how companies conceive (tưởng tượng), plan, develop, test, launch, deliver, and retire product from the market.
- There is no single organizational model for product management. 
- Can be an independent function or intergranted as a part of another function.
- The objection of these recommendations is to developing new products that have potential to generate profit for the company.
- PM:
    + prevent guesswords
    + misguided product development 
    + Missed opportunities.
- PM has 2 distinct focus areas: internal and external: influence how a company defines, develops, and delivers products.
    + internal area:
        + In the organizational environment.
        + It prefers applying products principles and techniques to develop and update for something and manage products (just use inside prganizational environment for sure)
        + some how, internal area includes human resources information systems (HRIS) or customer relationship management(CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP)
        + To sum up that shit, I can tell you that internal includes some aspects:
            1. Human resources
            2. Customer relationship management
            3. Enterprise resource planning
    + External area:

### 2/ Explain the internal and external aspect of PM

    3. UX/UI design: Create wireframe, prototypes, and visual elements to optimize the user interface and experience.
    4. App development: write app code, use frameworks and libraries, and intergrate APIs and backend server.
    5. Mobile app testing: perform various test for functionality, usability, performance, and sercurity. 
- Our Plan and setting up timeline. 
    1. Start time table: 7/3/2024
    2. End time table (predictalbe day: 1/5/2024)
- How long for each steps we will spend?
    1. Strategy development: 2 weeks - define the app idea, goals and target audience

        + Goals and target audience 7/3 - 8/3
        + Learning platforms: rest of time: 9/3 - 21/3
