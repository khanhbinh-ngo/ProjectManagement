## I. Define Product Management
### 1/ Define PM
- Project management is how companies conceive (tưởng tượng), plan, develop, test, launch, deliver, and retire product from the market.
- There is no single organizational model for product management. 
- Can be an independent function or intergranted as a part of another function.
- The objection of these recommendations is to developing new products that have potential to generate profit for the company.
- PM:
    + prevent guesswords
    + misguided product development 
    + Missed opportunities.
- PM has 2 distinct focus areas: internal and external: influence how a company defines, develops, and delivers products.
    + internal area:
        + In the organizational environment.
        + It prefers applying products principles and techniques to develop and update for something and manage products (just use inside prganizational environment for sure)
        + some how, internal area includes human resources information systems (HRIS) or customer relationship management(CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP)
        + To sum up that shit, I can tell you that internal includes some aspects:
            1. Human resources
            2. Customer relationship management
            3. Enterprise resource planning
    + External area:
